            <h1 class="manHeader">The Manuscript</h1>
            <h2>Manuscript: <a href="https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.ebr.402" target="_blank">Vat.ebr.402</a></h2>
            <h2>Material: Parchment</h2>
            <h2>Dimensions: 290mm x 240mm</h2>
            <h2>Binding: Codex, quaternions</h2>
            <h2>Script: Ashkenazic semi-cursive</h2>
            <p>The manuscript Vat.ebr.402 that is currently held by the Vatican Library is the only manuscript copy containing the poetry of Meir of Norwich.  The manuscript itself does not have much verifiable history.  From its age, the type of Hebrew script, and the Medieval Hebrew used, it was most likely written c. 1300 in Northern France, where many Jews fled to after being expelled from England in 1290.  After this vague origin, there is no record of its movement or ownership until 1887, when Abraham Berliner discovered the manuscript in the Vatican Archives.
</p>

            <p id="quote">"As far as I can see... the hair-side of the parchment can be distinguished from the flesh side, and the quires are pricked in the outer margins, a combination which characterizes Ashkenazic codices prior to the thirteenth century.  In the leaves of the rest of the codex pricks in both the inner and the outer margins can be seen."<br>Malachi Beit-ArieÃÅ, <i>The Makings of the Medieval Hebrew Book</i></p>

            <p>The manuscript was copied by three scribes.  The first scribe, whose name was probably Joseph (the name is singled out in the text on ff. 14v, 28r, 33r),  another scribe, whose name was perhaps Meshullam (the name is singled out in a few places, but may actually refer to another person) and a third scribe, Shemuel, who also singled out his name on a few random pages, and wrote a colophon on f. 79r.  On Ff. 114v-115v, the script is written by a fourth, unattributed scribe.<br><br>While we can say that Meir himself was English, it is unclear if Shemuel, who copied most his poetry, was also from England.</p>
            

            <p>Aside from the poems of Meir, which take up only a few brief pages, the manuscript is filled with a variety of documents (in order) : 
                <ul>
                    <li>a grammar dispute</li>
                    <li>a poem written in the shape of a vine</li>
                    <li>an elegy</li>
                    <li>a grammatical treatise</li>
                    <li>translation of an Arabic treatise</li>
                    <li>extracts on Masorah (The 24 books of the Tanakh collected and written by the Masoretes) and cantillation accents</li>
                    <li><b>the poetry of Meir of Norwich</b></li>
                    <li>treatise on vowels and cantillation accents</li>
                    <li>poems by a few different authors</li>
                    <li>an ethical poem</li>
                    <li>selections from Mishlei Arav (proverbs and ethical poems)</li>
                </ul>

            <p>The four poems of Meir of Norwich are written in this manuscript on pages 113v - 117v.</p>
